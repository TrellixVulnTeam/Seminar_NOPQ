Hi!

We are 3 students of the TU/e and we did this project for the TU/e Seminar course on diffential privacy.

For this project we had to implement 3 different classifiers:

- Naïve Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machines

and adapt them to support differential privacy. In this github repository the
implementations of the algorihthms can be found. 

We implemented the algorithms in python. In this readme the required packages
necessary to run the code will be mentioned. 

NAIVE BAYES:
The Naive Bayes classifier implementation is all wrapped up in a Jupyter notebook, 
which can be executed in an environment that supports jupyter notebooks. 
Such as jupyter lab or Google Colab.

The implementation requires at least Python version 3.6, and the following packages:

- time
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn.metrics
- scipy.stats


DECISION TREE:
The Decision Tree classifier implementation is all wrapped up in a Jupyter notebook,
which can be executed in an environment that supports jupyter notebooks.
Such as jupyter lab or Google Colab. 

The implementation requires at least Python version 3.8, and the following packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklean.metrics
- time

SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE:
The Support Vector Machine classifier implementation can be opened/executed with an
IDE that supports Python. Such as Pycharm.

The implementation requires at least Python version 3.8, and the following packages:

- Pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- time

Next to the required package the implementation has for every dataset a .py file. 
To run a test for a particular dataset, the corresponding .py file needs to be executed.



DATASETS:
To train, test and compare our algorithms we used several datasets. We included all
the datasets that were used in the dataset folder on this github repo.
Here we want to refer to them in an accurate and official way.
